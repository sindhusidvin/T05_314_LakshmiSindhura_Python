What is python?
Python is an interpreted,high level,dynamically typed,general purpose programming language.
* Interpreted: Here translation of code is done line by line.
* High level:It is the language which humans can understand.
* Dynamically typed: It means the type of variable and expression is decided during run time.
* General purpose programming language: It means it is designed to be used in a range of applications including
data science,software and  web development,automation etc.

Features of python?
* Python Is a Case-Sensitive Language
   It's the differentiation between lowercase and uppercase letters.
* It is an object oriented language as everything in python is an object.
* In python the programmer need to follow PEP 8 standards,these are standards which are to be followed while writing the code.
===============================================================================================================================================================
Advantages of python?
* It is free and open source.
* It is easy to code compared to other programming languages like Java,C++.
* Python supports to develop graphical user interfaces.
* Python language is also a portable language.
For example, if we have Python code for windows and if we want to run this code on
other platforms such as Linux, Unix, and Mac then we do not need to change it,
we can run this code on any platform.
=====================================================================================================================================================================
Disadvantages of python
* We can consider python programming language as slow because of two reasons
----as code is executed line by line and
----here datatype is decided during the runtime.
*Not suitable for Mobile and Game Development
Python is mostly used in desktop and web server-side development.
It is not considered ideal for mobile app development and game development due to the consumption of more memory and
its slow processing speed while compared to other programming languages.
* we can see runtime errors in python.

Why Python is so popular now a days?
Python has been used in web development, data analytics, machine learning, data science, data engineering,
and even machine learning and artificial intelligence. Many top businesses and software companies depend on Python
including Facebook, Google, Netflix, Instagram, and others.
